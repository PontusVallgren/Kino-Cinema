# Material UI

In previous course, teacher introduced Material UI a little bit to us. And we thought it would be good for using it to this project.

Having a unified design would be neat since it is a same website that we worked on. It was important that visitor would feel that all pages are connected by design.

So we discussed and decided to use some components with Material UI. For example, we use custom button(used MUI) that can be used again easily for everyone with our own theme colors.

Material UI prevent us from spending lots of time for css and its animation. And it supports icons as well, so didn't need to spend so much time to use icons.
